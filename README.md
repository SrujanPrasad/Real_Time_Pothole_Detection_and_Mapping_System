# Real-Time Pothole Detection System 

This project was developed as part of the Experiential Learning course to fulfil the requirements of the 5th Semester, and was later carried forward into the 6th Semester with further upgrades and modifications.

## Problem Statement
Every year, thousands of lives are lost on Indian roads due to accidents, with a significant proportion caused by potholes. 
These accidents are more frequent and dangerous during the monsoon season when potholes are hidden under water. 
Poor road infrastructure and the inability to detect potholes in real time pose a serious threat to vehicle safety. 
A dedicated system can detect potholes in real-time and alert drivers effectively, which would greatly reduce the risk of accidents, enabling vehicles to avoid hazards and save lives. 
Such a solution would enhance road safety and ensure a smoother, safer driving experience.
